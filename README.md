#Fake News Detection with GPT
#Overview
The Fake News Detection project leverages advanced AI models, specifically GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer), to identify and classify fake news articles. This project aims to help users and organizations detect misinformation and improve the reliability of news consumption.

#Features
1.News Classification: Classify articles as 'Fake' or 'Real' using GPT-based models
2."Know More" gives you vast knowlege about given news
3.It also gives an option to know global and indian news as per user wish
4.ChatBot is an exquisite feature which gives you the short and simple summary about any entered news.It saves a lot of time and energy of user
5.You can even "Check Url" of any website to know its accuracy.

##ABOUT
* Fake news detection is the process of identifying and filtering out false or misleading information from legitimate news content. In today's digital age, where information spreads rapidly across social media and online platforms, the ability to discern truth from deception has become increasingly crucial. The prevalence of fake news can lead to misinformation, manipulate public opinion, and even incite social unrest. As such, detecting and combating fake news is vital for maintaining the integrity of information and fostering a well-informed society.

* To achieve accurate fake news detection, we leverage advanced machine learning (ML) and deep learning techniques, combined with natural language processing (NLP) and sophisticated models like GPT-4. These technologies work together to analyze the text, context, and patterns in news content, enabling the system to distinguish between authentic and fabricated stories. By training models on large datasets of real and fake news, we can create a robust detection system that continuously improves its accuracy. Artificial intelligence and machine learning (AIML) play a crucial role in this process, offering the computational power and intelligence needed to tackle the complexity of modern fake news.

* Beyond just detecting fake news, our system offers additional features to enhance the user experience and provide more value. If the news is determined to be real, users can access more related stories to gain a deeper understanding of the topic. The platform also provides a list of the top 10 news stories of the day, ensuring users stay informed on the most important current events. Additionally, we have integrated a chatbot feature to interact with users, answer questions, and provide summaries of the news. These features create a comprehensive and user-friendly platform designed not only to detect fake news but also to enrich the overall news consumption experience.
